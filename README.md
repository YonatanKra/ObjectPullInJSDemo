# ObjectPullInJSDemo
Confront JS lightning talk about Object Pools

## Instructions
Just load the `index.html` file on chrome and open the console to see the time (preferably with an http-server).

Use the performance tool to compare the amount of GC with and without the object pool.

To see the example without an object pool: `git checkout step_1`

To see the example with an object pool: `git checkout step_2`
